"Steps I followed to use SFTP command-line tool":


-I toke the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general

environment. Then I used the hostname, username, and password provided
for the sandbox environment.

-Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I wanted to upload the
screenshots.

-I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to
the sandbox environment.
